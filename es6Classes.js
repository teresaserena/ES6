/*here, make a class called createCharacter with a constructor that takes age and name. Make it have a function called "addStats" that returns some stats for your character. You will be passed 5 numbers. Label them however you'd like, but just make sure to return them all as a single string. Finally, instantiate a new createCharacter object called characterOne with an age and name.*/
